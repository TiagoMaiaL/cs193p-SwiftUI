# Assignment 3

> Implement a game of solo (i.e. one player) Set.
> The goal of this assignment is to give you an opportunity to create your first app completely from scratch by yourself. It is similar enough to the first two assignments that you should be able to find your bearings, but different enough to give you the full experience!
